        <h1>But what exactly is a matrix</h1>
        <h3>a matrix (also known as a 2D or multidimensional array), is a container for many values.</h3>
        <h3>one example would be a tic-tac-toe board, a 3x3 matrix</h3>

        <blockquote cite="https://news.mit.edu/2013/explained-matrices-1206">
            One of the areas of computer science in which matrix multiplication is particularly useful is graphics, since a digital image is basically a matrix to begin with: <br> The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to rows and columns of pixels, and the numerical entries correspond to the pixels’ color values. <br> Decoding digital video, for instance, requires matrix multiplication; earlier this year, MIT researchers were able to build one of the first chips to implement the new high-efficiency video-coding standard for ultrahigh-definition TVs, in part because of patterns they discerned in the matrices it employs. <br><br>

In the same way that matrix multiplication can help process digital video, it can help process digital sound.<br> A digital audio signal is basically a sequence of numbers, representing the variation over time of the air pressure of an acoustic audio signal. <br><br>

        <h3>Other Major use cases of matrices include:
            <ul>
                <li>Machine learning</li>
                <li>AI ( particularly in self driving cars)</li>
                <li>2D and 3D Graphics</li>
            </ul>
            In the case of graphics we need them to perform transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation, on a potentially huge number of points and quickly within a 2D or 3D space.
            
            <br><br>
            lets say you have a 3D wheel made up of 100 triangles, each having 3 points, all relative to the origin (0,0,0) or "center" of the wheel. <br><br>

            in order to fixate or anchor this wheel to the body of your car <br> you will need to *translate* all of the points in your wheels 3-dimensional array relative to the car. <br>
            
            in fact, even chains of transformations (translate-> rotate-> scale-> translate) can be combined into a single matrix that does it all in one step.

        <h4>
            Understanding matrices is essential to understanding graphics and many other complex fields of computer science. It opens the doors to understanding Camera coordination, rendering, model manipulation, deep learning, likely a great many of the future advancements yet to come in technology. Graphics boards have specialized hardware for doing matrix math, making this blindingly efficient - so you can’t really do 3D graphics without matrices. They sit as an anchor of knowledge for many directions you may want to take your career/business. <br>
